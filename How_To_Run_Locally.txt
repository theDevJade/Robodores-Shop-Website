You must have Docker installed first.

Run these commands in powershell

cd "Parent folder of program"

then run "copy backend\.env.example backend\.env "       

then run "docker compose up --build"

Once the containers start, the Vite dev server binds to all IPv4 interfaces, so you can open the UI from another device on your network via http://<your-computers-ipv4-address>:5173 as well as http://localhost:5173.
